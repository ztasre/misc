/*
Problem 31: Coin sums

In England the currency is made up of pound, -L-, and pence, p, and there
are eight coins in general circulation:

  1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, -L-1 (100p) and -L-2 (200p).

It is possible to make -L-2 in the following way:

  1 * -L-1 + 1 * 50p + 2 * 20p + 1 * 5p + 1 * 2p + 3 * 1p

How many different ways can -L-2 be made using any number of coins?

// I'm pretty sure this is solvable with generating functions & sage. In
// fact it becomes trivial.

// tree never breaks a depth of 200, stack is safe
// this is very slow :(

// count these manually to reduce tree size
// 200  1
// 100 + 100 1
// 100 + countChange(100)
// countChange(200) (but no 100 & 200 piece)

// this didn't work, counts every possibility, duplicated are treated as unique
// too bad it was really pretty & fast
