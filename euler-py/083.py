Project Euler Problem 83
========================

NOTE: This problem is a significantly more challenging version of
   Problem 81.

In the 5 by 5 matrix below, the minimal path sum from the top left to the
bottom right, by moving left, right, up, and down, is indicated in red and
is equal to 2297.

                           131 673 234 103 18
                           201 96  342 965 150
